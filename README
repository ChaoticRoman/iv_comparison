== Mission statement ==
The aim of this effort is to choose simple and reliable LED driver design.
Both linear and switched mode power supplies circuit and commercial modules
should be considered from simple linear NPN fixed-current driver


Important parameters of each design are input voltage range, current rating,
line and load regulation, over-current protection (OCP), thermal protection,
adjustability.
