Mission statement
-----------------
The aim of this effort is to choose simple and reliable LED driver design.
Both linear and switched mode power supplies circuits and commercial modules
should be considered from simple linear NPN fixed-current driver to complex
boost-buck switched mode power supplies (SMPS) topologies.

Considered parameters of design are:
* input voltage range
* current rating, precision, over-current protection (OCP)
* line and load regulation
* efficiency
* thermal protection
* overvoltage protection
* inrush current, soft-start
* failure modes, reliability
* adjustability, diagnostics
* price, size,  complexity
* EM emissions

Single design should be choosed, tested and characterized. KiCad schematics
and example layout, BOM, budget and proof-of-concept device shall be delivered.

Mission requirements specification
----------------------------------
